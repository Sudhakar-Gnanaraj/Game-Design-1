Overview

This animation project is designed to visually represent the emotional transition from a state of peace to a state of fear using minimalistic landscape visuals and interactive elements. The transition is triggered by a mouse click, shifting the viewer from a calm, serene environment to one of turmoil and disturbance.

Breakdown

Upright, symmetric trees with oval canopies.
Smooth rolling hills.

Animation 2: Fear

Visual Elements:
Trees are now slanted, as if bent by a powerful wind.
Strong contrast in lighting (dark red and black hues dominate the scene).
Heavy rainfall is animated with slanted lines.

Future Improvements
Add sound effects for immersive visuals.
Introduce a transitional animation (e.g., wind picking up, sky darkening).
